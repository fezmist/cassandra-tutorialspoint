cassandra notes:
================
overview of each file:
CRC - A single CRC of the data file
Compression - the name of the compressio engine used
Data - The SSTable data stored in sorted order by Partition/Cluster Key
Digest - one or more CRCs one per 2GB segment of the data file
Filter - The bloom filter -  folded hashes of all key values in the data file
Index - a list of all Partition/Cluster Keys
Statistics - Hodgepodge of metadata about the SSTable
Summary - a list of some of the Partition/Cluster keys - think second level index
TOC - text list of files

CCM - Cassandra Cluster Manager

hexdump mb-1-big-CRC.db

cat mb-1-big-Digest.crc32

cat mb-1-big-TOC.txt

hexdump -c mb-1-big-Statistics.db

conclusions:
----------- 
- cassandra 3.0 SSTable format is considerably more compact
- field names are no longer stored in the data file field ids are used instead
- TTL and timestamps are grouped
- TTL and timestamp differeces are stored as deltas
- SSTables are sorted by partition key token values
- statistics file is full of bunch of different stuff
- Data, Summary, Filter and Statistics have important useful stuff
